Jump to a project's files using completion based on context.

With a prefix ARG invalidates the cache first.

If point is on a filename, Projectile first tries to search for that
file in project:

- If it finds just a file, it switches to that file instantly.  This works even
if the filename is incomplete, but there's only a single file in the current project
that matches the filename at point.  For example, if there's only a single file named
\"projectile/projectile.el\" but the current filename is \"projectile/proj\" (incomplete),
`projectile-find-file' still switches to \"projectile/projectile.el\" immediately
 because this is the only filename that matches.

files is displayed when a filename appears more than one in the project or the
filename at point is a prefix of more than two files in a project.  For example,
if `projectile-find-file' is executed on a filepath like \"projectile/\", it lists
the content of that directory.  If it is executed on a partial filename like
 \"projectile/a\", a list of files with character 'a' in that directory is presented.
