Dash-Fontify mode is a buffer-local minor mode intended for Emacs
Lisp buffers.  Enabling it causes the special variables bound in
anaphoric Dash macros to be fontified.  These anaphoras include
`it', `it-index', `acc', and `other'.  In older Emacs versions
which do not dynamically detect macros, Dash-Fontify mode
additionally fontifies Dash macro calls.

PACKAGE can be either a simple package name or a package name
with a modifier before the name to specify local recipe source
information:

* `<owner>/' : specifies a Github owner name
* `gist:<id>' : specifies a Gist ID
* `<type>:' : specifies a type of the package source

If `FEATURE in PACKAGE' form is used instead of PACKAGE, then
that FEATURE is `require'd after installing PACKAGE.  You can
also use `el-get-bundle!' macro if FEATURE and PACKAGE are the
same.  If you wish to `require' more than one feature, then use
`:features' property in FORM.

The initialization FORM may start with a property list that
describes a local recipe.  The property list may include the keyword
`:bundle-sync' with a value of either `t' or `nil' to request that
`el-get-bundle' invoke `el-get' synchronously (respectively asynchronously).
The keyword `:bundle-async' is the inverse of `:bundle-sync'.

circumstances: see the definition of `el-get-bundle-el-get' for details.)

(autoload 'async-start "emacs-async/async" "\
Execute START-FUNC (often a lambda) in a subordinate Emacs process.
When done, the return value is passed to FINISH-FUNC.  Example:

    (async-start

       (lambda ()
         (message \"This is a test\")
         (sleep-for 3)

       ;; What to do when it finishes
       (lambda (result)
         (message \"Async process done, result should be 222: %s\"
                  result)))

If FINISH-FUNC is nil or missing, a future is returned that can
be inspected using `async-get', blocking until the value is
ready.  Example:

    (let ((proc (async-start
                   ;; What to do in the child process
                   (lambda ()
                     (message \"This is a test\")
                     (sleep-for 3)
                     222))))

        (message \"I'm going to do some work here\") ;; ....

        (message \"Waiting on async process, result should be 222: %s\"
                 (async-get proc)))

If you don't want to use a callback, and you don't care about any
return value from the child process, pass the `ignore' symbol as
the second argument (if you don't, and never call `async-get', it
will leave *emacs* process buffers hanging around):

    (async-start
     (lambda ()
       (delete-file \"a remote file on a slow link\" nil))
     \\='ignore)

Special case:
If the output of START-FUNC is a string with properties
e.g. (buffer-string) RESULT will be transformed in a list where the
car is the string itself (without props) and the cdr the rest of
properties, this allows using in FINISH-FUNC the string without
properties and then apply the properties in cdr to this string (if
needed).
Properties handling special objects like markers are returned as
list to allow restoring them later.
See <https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async/issues/145> for more infos.

Note: Even when FINISH-FUNC is present, a future is still
returned except that it yields no value (since the value is
passed to FINISH-FUNC).  Call `async-get' on such a future always
returns nil.  It can still be useful, however, as an argument to
`async-ready' or `async-wait'.

Use `flycheck-select-checker' to select a checker for the current
buffer manually.

If you run into issues, use `\\[flycheck-verify-setup]' to get help.

Flycheck supports many languages out of the box, and many
additional ones are available on MELPA.  Adding new ones is very
easy.  Complete documentation is available online at URL
`https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/'.  Please report issues and
request features at URL `https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck'.

Flycheck displays its status in the mode line.  In the default
configuration, it looks like this:

`FlyC'     This buffer has not been checked yet.
`FlyC-'    Flycheck doesn't have a checker for this buffer.
`FlyC*'    Flycheck is running.  Expect results soon!
`FlyC:3|2' This buffer contains three warnings and two errors.
           Use `\\[flycheck-list-errors]' to see the list.

You may also see the following icons:
`FlyC!'    The checker crashed.
`FlyC.'    The last syntax check was manually interrupted.
`FlyC?'    The checker did something unexpected, like exiting with 1
           but returning no errors.

Define a new error LEVEL with PROPERTIES.

The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:

`:severity SEVERITY'
     A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher
     the number, the more severe is this level compared to other
     levels.  Defaults to 0; info is -10, warning is 10, and
     error is 100.

     The severity is used by `flycheck-error-level-<' to
     determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.

`:compilation-level LEVEL'

     A number indicating the broad class of messages that errors
     at this level belong to: one of 0 (info), 1 (warning), or
     2 or nil (error).  Defaults to nil.

     This is used by `flycheck-checker-pattern-to-error-regexp'
     to map error levels into `compilation-mode''s hierarchy and
     to get proper highlighting of errors in `compilation-mode'.

`:overlay-category CATEGORY'
     A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
     highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
     node `(elisp)Overlay Properties' for more information about
     overlay categories.

     A category for an error level overlay should at least define
     the `face' property, for error highlighting.  Another useful
     property for error level categories is `priority', to
     influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays.

`:fringe-bitmap BITMAPS'
     A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
     indicators for this level, or a cons of two bitmaps (one for
     narrow fringes and one for wide fringes).  See Info node
     `(elisp)Fringe Bitmaps' for more information about fringe
     bitmaps, including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.

`:fringe-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for fringe indicators
     for this level.

`:margin-spec SPEC'
     A display specification indicating what to display in the
     margin when `flycheck-indication-mode' is `left-margin' or
     `right-margin'.  See Info node `(elisp)Displaying in the
     Margins'.  If omitted, Flycheck generates an image spec from
     the fringe bitmap.

     COMMAND is a list of the form `(EXECUTABLE [ARG ...])'.

     EXECUTABLE is a string with the executable of this syntax
     checker.  It can be overridden with the variable
     `flycheck-SYMBOL-executable'.  Note that this variable is
     NOT implicitly defined by this function.  Use
     `flycheck-def-executable-var' to define this variable.

     Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,
     or as special symbol or form for
     `flycheck-substitute-argument', which see.

`:error-patterns PATTERNS'
     A list of patterns to parse the output of the `:command'.

     Each ITEM in PATTERNS is a list `(LEVEL SEXP ...)', where
     LEVEL is a Flycheck error level (see
     `flycheck-define-error-level'), followed by one or more RX
     `SEXP's which parse an error of that level and extract line,
     column, file name and the message.

     See `rx' for general information about RX, and
     `flycheck-rx-to-string' for some special RX forms provided
     by Flycheck.

     All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
     whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
     by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
     other words, the first pattern wins.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, however, an
     `:error-parser' is mandatory.

`:error-parser FUNCTION'
     A function to parse errors with.

     The function shall accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER
     BUFFER.  OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,
     CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a
     buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function
     must return a list of `flycheck-error' objects parsed from
     OUTPUT.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to
     `flycheck-parse-with-patterns'.  In this case,
     `:error-patterns' is mandatory.

`:standard-input t'
     Whether to send the buffer contents on standard input.

     If this property is given and has a non-nil value, send the
     contents of the buffer on standard input.

     Defaults to nil.

Note that you may not give `:start', `:interrupt', and
`:print-doc' for a command checker.  You can give a custom
`:verify' function, though, whose results will be appended to the
default `:verify' function of command checkers.
